# Readme

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Accesses the GitHub API to generate a list of projects from the echoatday user account, excluding projects with 'echoatday' in the title.

Uses Sass primarily for the responsive Contact menu, with standard CSS3 styling for other animations and UI elements.

Website code is split into page-About.js and page-Projects.js for their respective sections, with the header in App.js.
